In this project, we will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images. Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset will be used to train our network.

The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

    1_Preliminaries.ipynb
    2_Training.ipynb
    3_Inference.ipynb
